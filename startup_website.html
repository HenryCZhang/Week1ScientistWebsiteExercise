             This seminal paper gave birth to special relativity (SR). In particular, it stated the two postulates of SR (uniform motion is undetectable, and the speed of light is always constant) and its kinematics.

            <div class="articleNames">Kinetic Theory of Thermal Equilibrium and of the Second Law of Thermodynamics:</div>
            <div id="articleText2">Two physical systems are in thermal equilibrium if there is no net flow of thermal energy between them when they are connected by a path permeable to heat. Thermal equilibrium obeys the zeroth law of thermodynamics. A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially uniform and temporally constant.</div>

            </div>
            <div id="articleText3">Capillarity is a physical phenomenon in which liquids flow without the help of gravity. Liquid even rise to a height against gravity, through narrow tubes. Capillary action is due to the phenomenon of surface tension of liquid as well as adhesive forces between liquid molecules and molecules of the narrow tube.</div>
